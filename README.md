# fire-detection-from-images
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate a fire detection neural net that can be deployed to an edge device, presumed to be connected to a camera that might be in a fixed location or on a roving drone.

## Motivation and challenges
Traditional smoke detectors work by [detecting the physical presence of smoke particles](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Staying-safe/Safety-equipment/Smoke-alarms/Ionization-vs-photoelectric). However they are prone to false detections (e.g. from toasters) and do not localise the fire particularly well. In these situations a camera solution could complement a traditional detector, in order to improve response times or to provide additional metrics such as the size and location of a fire. With the location and nature of the fire identified, an automated intervention may be possible, e.g. via a sprinkler system or drone. Also data can be sent to fire services to provide otherwise non-existent situational awareness. Particular locations I am interested in are: kitchens & living rooms, garages and outbuildings, and areas where fires might already be present but spreading outside a desired zone e.g. fire pit.

There are a couple of significant challenges & open questions:
* Gathering or locating a comprehensive, representative and balanced training dataset
* Handling different viewpoints, different camera manufacturers and settings, and different ambient lighting conditions.
* Since fires are so bright they can often wash out images and cause other optical disturbances, or use [water based](https://www.hackster.io/ben-eagan/fire-from-water-9e6ae4) fire simulators
* Is a single 'super' model preferable, or many more specialised models?
* Since we expect the model will have limitations, how do we make the model results interpretable?

Ideas:
* Preprocessing images, e.g. to remove background or apply filters
* Classifying short sequences of video, since the movement of fire is quite characteristic
* Simulated data, identify any software which can generate realistic fires and add to existing datasets
* Augmentations to simulate effect of different cameras and exposure settings
* Combining multiple signals including [thermal](http://www.nationalfirefighter.com/blog/Technological-Advances-A-Closer-Look-at-Thermal-Imaging) & priors to improve [ROC characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)

## Tooling and approach
* Frames will be fed through neural net. On positive detection of fire metrics are extracted. Ignore smoke for MVP. Try various architectures & parameters to establish a 'good' baseline model.
* Remain open to pytorch & tensorflow2. However for low cost solution probably tensorflow-lite should be used.
* Use Google Colab for training and host images on Google drive which has a nice UI, desktop apps with sync, easy auth. Additionally or alternatively use kaggle, any particular advantages vs colab?
* Identify any relevant guidance/legislation on required accuracy of fire detection techniques
* [Seek thermal camera addon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seek-Thermal-UT-EAA-Protective-Waterproof-Black/dp/B00Y2QO6N0?th=1) is relatively low cost and can be used for gathering [thermal dataset](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/thermal-dogs-and-people)

## Fire safety references
* Locate reference covering the different kinds of fires in the home, common scenarios & interventions
* Safety/accuracy standards for fire detectors, including ROC characteristics

## Fires in the home
* Common causes including cigarettes left smouldering, candles, electrical failures, chip pan fires
* A large number of factors affect the nature of the fire, primarily the fuel and oxygenation, but also where the fire is, middle of the room/against a wall, thermal capacity of a room, the walls, ambient temperature, humidity, contaminants on the material (dust, oil based products, emollients etc)
* To put out a fire a number of retardants are considered - water (not on electrical or chip pan), foam, CO2, dry powder
* In electrical fires the electricity supply should first be isolated
* Reducing ventillation, e.g. by closing doors, will limit fire
* Smoke itself is a strong indicator of the nature of the fire
* Read https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle and https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion

## Comments
* Firenet is a VERY common name for model, do not use
