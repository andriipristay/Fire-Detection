Detect fire in images using neural nets

## Articles & repos
* [Fire and smoke detection with Keras and Deep Learning by pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/11/18/fire-and-smoke-detection-with-keras-and-deep-learning/) - dataset collected by scraping Google images (provides link to dataset with  1315 fire images), binary Fire/Non-fire classification with tf2 & keras sequential CNN, achieve 92% accuracy, concludes that better datasets are required
* [Fire Detection from scratch using YOLOv3](https://medium.com/@b117020/fire-detection-using-neural-networks-4d52c5cd55c5) - discusses annotation using LabelImg, using Google drive and Colab, deployment via Heroku and viz using Streamlit
* [fire-detect-yolov4](https://github.com/gengyanlei/fire-detect-yolov4) - training of Yolo v4 model
* [midasklr/FireSmokeDetectionByEfficientNet](https://github.com/midasklr/FireSmokeDetectionByEfficientNet) - Fire and smoke classification and detection using efficientnet, pytorch, visualizes the activation map
* [arpit-jadon/FireNet-LightWeight-Network-for-Fire-Detection](https://github.com/arpit-jadon/FireNet-LightWeight-Network-for-Fire-Detection) - A Specialized Lightweight Fire & Smoke Detection Model for Real-Time IoT Applications (e.g. on RPi), accuracy approx. 95%.

## Datasets
* [FireNET](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/FireNET) - approx. 500 images with bounding boxes
* [cair/Fire-Detection-Image-Dataset](https://github.com/cair/Fire-Detection-Image-Dataset) - This dataset contains normal images and images with fire, and is highly unbalanced to reciprocate real world situations.
* [mivia Fire Detection Dataset](https://mivia.unisa.it/datasets/video-analysis-datasets/fire-detection-dataset/) - approx. 30 videos
* [USTC smoke detection](http://smoke.ustc.edu.cn/datasets.htm) - links to various sources that provide videos of smoke
* fire/not-fire dataset in the pyimagesearch article. Note that there are many umages of fire scenes that do not contain actual fire, but burnt out homes for example 

## Comments
* firenet is a VERY common name for model, do not use
