# fire-detection-from-images
Detect fire in images using neural nets.

The purpose of this repo is to first identify relevant datasets and publications, then demonstrate a state of the art model published alongside the dataset.

## Articles & repos
* [Fire and smoke detection with Keras and Deep Learning by pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/11/18/fire-and-smoke-detection-with-keras-and-deep-learning/) - dataset collected by scraping Google images (provides link to dataset with  1315 fire images), binary Fire/Non-fire classification with tf2 & keras sequential CNN, achieve 92% accuracy, concludes that better datasets are required

* [Fire Detection using CCTV images â€” Monk Library Application](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/fire-detection-using-cctv-images-monk-library-application-242df1fca2b9) - keras classifier on kaggle datasets,  handy [notebook](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1/blob/master/study_roadmaps/4_image_classification_zoo/Classifier%20-%20Fire%20presence%20recognition%20in%20cctv-images.ipynb)

## Datasets
* [FireNET](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/FireNET) - approx. 500 images with bounding boxes
* [cair/Fire-Detection-Image-Dataset](https://github.com/cair/Fire-Detection-Image-Dataset) - This dataset contains normal images and images with fire, and is highly unbalanced to reciprocate real world situations.
* [mivia Fire Detection Dataset](https://mivia.unisa.it/datasets/video-analysis-datasets/fire-detection-dataset/) - approx. 30 videos
* [USTC smoke detection](http://smoke.ustc.edu.cn/datasets.htm) - links to various sources that provide videos of smoke
* fire/not-fire dataset in the pyimagesearch article. Note that there are many umages of fire scenes that do not contain actual fire, but burnt out homes for example 
* [Fire Detection from CCTV on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ritupande/fire-detection-from-cctv) - images and video
* [FIRE Dataset on Kaggle]() - 755 outdoor-fire images and 244 non-fire images 

## Comments
* firenet is a VERY common name for model, do not use
