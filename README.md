# fire-detection-from-images
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate a fire detection neural net that can be deployed to an edge device, presumed to be connected to a camera that might be in a fixed location or on a roving drone.

## Motivation and challenges
Traditional smoke detectors work by [detecting the physical presence of smoke particles](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Staying-safe/Safety-equipment/Smoke-alarms/Ionization-vs-photoelectric). However they are prone to false detections (e.g. from toasters) and do not localise the fire particularly well. In these situations a camera solution could complement a traditional detector, in order to improve response times or to provide additional metrics such as the size and location of a fire. With the location and nature of the fire identified, an automated intervention may be possible, e.g. via a sprinkler system or drone. Also data can be sent to fire services to provide otherwise non-existent situational awareness. Particular locations I am interested in are: kitchens & living rooms, garages and outbuildings, and areas where fires might already be present but spreading outside a desired zone e.g. fire pit.

There are a couple of significant challenges & open questions:
* Gathering or locating a comprehensive, representative and balanced training dataset
* Handling different viewpoints, different camera manufacturers and settings, and different ambient lighting conditions.
* Since fires are so bright they can often wash out images and cause other optical disturbances, or use [water based](https://www.hackster.io/ben-eagan/fire-from-water-9e6ae4) fire simulators
* Is a single 'super' model preferable, or many more specialised models?
* Since we expect the model will have limitations, how do we make the model results interpretable?

Ideas:
* Preprocessing images, e.g. to remove background or apply filters
* Classifying short sequences of video, since the movement of fire is quite characteristic
* Simulated data, identify any software which can generate realistic fires and add to existing datasets
* Augmentations to simulate effect of different cameras and exposure settings
* Combining multiple signals & priors to improve [ROC characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)

## Tooling and approach
* Frames will be fed through neural net. On positive detection of fire metrics are extracted. Ignore smoke for MVP. Try various architectures & parameters to establish a 'good' baseline model.
* Remain open to pytorch & tensorflow2. However for low cost solution probably tensorflow-lite should be used.
* Use Google Colab for training and host images on Google drive which has a nice UI, desktop apps with sync, easy auth. Additionally or alternatively use kaggle, any particular advantages vs colab?
* Identify any relevant guidance/legislation on required accuracy of fire detection techniques

* fire/not-fire dataset in the pyimagesearch article can be downloaded. Note that there are many images of fire scenes that do not contain actual fire, but burnt out homes for example.
* [FIRE Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/phylake1337/fire-dataset) - 755 outdoor fire images and 244 non-fire images. Many glossy images, representative?
