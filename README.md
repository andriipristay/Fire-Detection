# fire-detection-from-images
Detect fire in images using neural nets.

The purpose of this repo is to first identify relevant datasets and publications, then demonstrate a state of the art fire detection model that can be deployed to an edge device. Explore speed/accuracy tradeoffs & determine practical solution to deployment. Biggest challenge appears to be gathering comprehensive yet representative training dataset.

## Tooling and approach
* Frames will be fed through a fire/smoke/normal classifier. On positive detecion of fire/smoke frames are fed to an object detection model to determine the size/severity of the fire.
* Remain open to pytorch & tensorflow2
* Use Google Colab for training and host images on Google drive which has a nice UI, desktop apps with sync, easy auth
* Additionally use kaggle for training and data hosting? Not personally a fan of the kaggle UI, but keeping everything on kaggle simplifies auth, integration, version control, reproducibility
* Identify any relevant guidance/legislation on required accuracy of fire detection techniques

## Datasets
* [FireNET](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/FireNET) - approx. 500 images with bounding boxes
* [cair/Fire-Detection-Image-Dataset](https://github.com/cair/Fire-Detection-Image-Dataset) - This dataset contains normal images and images with fire, and is highly unbalanced to reciprocate real world situations.
* [mivia Fire Detection Dataset](https://mivia.unisa.it/datasets/video-analysis-datasets/fire-detection-dataset/) - approx. 30 videos
* [USTC smoke detection](http://smoke.ustc.edu.cn/datasets.htm) - links to various sources that provide videos of smoke
* fire/not-fire dataset in the pyimagesearch article. Note that there are many umages of fire scenes that do not contain actual fire, but burnt out homes for example 
* [Fire Detection from CCTV on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ritupande/fire-detection-from-cctv) - images and video
* [FIRE Dataset on Kaggle]() - 755 outdoor-fire images and 244 non-fire images 

## Comments
* firenet is a VERY common name for model, do not use
