## IceVision
* Recommended on fastai forum to checkout [IceVision](https://github.com/airctic/icevision) for object detection with custom training
* IceVision is an Object-Detection Framework that connects to different libraries/frameworks such as Fastai, Pytorch Lightning, and Pytorch with more to come.
* Worked through getting started guide with no issues. Can use exact notebook for fine tuning on fire dataset
* First step is [loading the dataset](https://github.com/airctic/icedata#coco-and-voc-compatible-datasets) which is in (Pascal) VOC format
